    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h2>Form a team</h4>
                    <p>Form a team of three from your studio. We suggest that you seek out teammates who bring together complementary skills and who have compatible schedules and priorities. If your studio cannot divide evenly into groups of three, talk to the studio staff about options. You are welcome to choose your own team, but for the best experience we recommend working with a different team than P2. You will stick with this team for the rest of the quarter, executing the final project across both P3 and P4.</p>

               <div id="plan" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Write a needfinding plan</h4>
                    <p>You are welcome to choose any direction that fits within the studio theme. You may take ideas from lecture, or brainstorm your own. Remember that it may take some time to set up the interviews and the trip, so start early. We may be able to help connect you with relevant user groups. Look past the people and environments that are readily accessible: focus on opportunities that will teach us something. For example, if you're studying health, Vaden is nearby but doesn't give you new perspectives, so avoid it. To help your selection, identify relevant stakeholders — people directly involved or implicated in the activity. For example, if you are interested in elder care, potential stakeholders include the elderly being cared for, family members, and health care professionals.</p>

                    <p>Decide on a needfinding plan, focusing on with whom and where you want to do your needfinding. Produce a shot list of your stakeholders, including how or where you might find them, interview them, and observe them. What do you hope to learn? Who will you talk to? What will you be sketching? This should be at least two solid paragraphs. The <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/BootcampBootleg2010v2SLIM.pdf">d.school bootcamp bootleg</a> has good ideas about different ways to frame your needfinding. Example helpful sections include interview preparation and extreme users.</p>

                    <p>Next, put together a discussion guide of questions and topics to cover when you go out on your interviews. The discussion guide should record verbatim your introduction, the questions you are going to ask, what activities (if any) you are planning on doing with the participants, and (if any) survey questions you will be distributing over the web. The verbatim part is key because if you ask leading questions, the needfinding will be useless. The <a href="../readings/needfinding-patnaik.pdf">Asking Questions section in Patnaik</a> should help.</p>

                    <h2>Observation</h4>
                    <p>Execute on your needfinding plan and gather your observations. Capture a mix of sketches, text, and when appropriate, photo and video.</p>

                    <p>Compile your team's observations together into one PDF. Now, filter your raw materials into five pages of your most interesting observations that the course staff can look at, and copy them into another PDF, alongside a couple sentences each of explanation if you'd like. Bring these selections to studio.</p>

                    <p>As part of your synthesis, generate three people profiles to capture different stakeholders or user groups. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hBcZuyHrgmr3cjRwsgiKO3rwcz2z-xv963EBkSaDp3w/edit?usp=sharing">(See a template here that you can copy and edit for your submission.)</a> People profiles ensure that you have enough depth on a perspective from your conversations to tell a story. They help your results become more emotionally resonant.</p>                    

                    <p>Next milestone will be to produce interpretations of these observations.</p>
